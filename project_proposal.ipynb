    "##### Motivation\n",
    "The main motivation and purpose of this project is to help myself and other identify mountains when hiking. It can often be difficult to tell one from another and I think this application could help fellow hikers ensure that they're looking at what they think they're looking at!\n",

    "##### Tech Stack\n",
    "The tech I will be using is mostly new to to me. This starts data mining in the form of webscraping sites like Instagram, Twitter, and Google. I have never done webscrapping before so I will have to research into it. Then I will do data cleaning which will involve ensuring the pictures are actually pictures of mountains and then labelling them (this step will probably be done during the data mining phase). "
